Hello everyone, this is second attempt to start the non-intuitive bits podcast today and it is as usually brought to you by Leaders Club that you are part two if you are listening to us but do consider elevating your club membership by joining the discord and discord channel link can be found in the description and as usual today with me in this virtual studio we have several folks Dmitry Manannikov do say hi to our listeners hello hello and Nishan Sharma hello and as usual the most annoying sound that you will be hearing it's my voice Slava Kovalevskyi I think this is the first time all three of us in this season together I don't think there was more than two people at any of the episodes I think so I only did once with you in you mean in this season yeah ah got it got it got it okay okay okay we have tons of the interesting topic today that have happened and for the warm-up there is so many small thing that I wanted to share with both of you folks but does anyone have anything to share before we jump to the warm-up topics something small interesting that have happened we have a list of books I see I can talk about one I found recently it's called the art of thinking clearly it's very similar to famous thinking fast and slow but it's more on practical side essentially like pretty small book I don't know maybe like hundred hundred fifty pages and it's about different biases and for each bias is like two three pages and then cross links between them the author mentioned that he created this book as a like initially starts as a list of personal notes about his own biases and then he organized and decided okay why not to make a book so it's actually pretty cool it's like a small pocket books that I can get back and to check okay is it something I have right now again it's not really heavy on like science side and many things you know but it's nice to have this like well organized so can recommend it especially it's not really expensive and it has audio version so if you want not sure how audio version would be better because again it's really nice as a cooking book you know like okay what what I have today you can open it and see that made you be audio as well got it got and by the way you shouldn't just mention that we have a blue video so Dimitri would you also say that we have a blue video this is just download speed on the Nishan site do you mean on YouTube or the screen that slava sharing that oh yeah that one is blurry okay I have no idea what YouTube folks are but anyway I abruptly ended the live stream and they have to found the second live stream so there is a chance that no one will be listening life anyway but who knows who knows we'll see how it will go and honestly I have no idea what to do about this I have no clue how to fix that actually let me quickly start to stop sharing and present again maybe maybe somehow this will fix but I don't think so good good old turn it off and exactly yes no Jesus okay then then I don't know what to do about it yeah we will have just just just to live with it honestly I don't know how it looks on the YouTube maybe I will double check about I'm pretty sure it will be the same blurry there I guess I guess now I just have to do it okay so anything else about this book my friend because I actually also have a book to share since we are book sharing in a book sharing mood no I'm halfway through his book again I just wanted I it was something that I searched for a long time I found but what whoever wants to read just need to read annotations and to see I can't really say it's great book it's like practical it's reasonable book okay I just just check the YouTube it's fine it's not blurry there so whatever meat is doing it's it's it's doing the shitty job but yes it's reasonable you do okay so coming back to the books topics then let me also share one and that would be I'm quickly searching the notes I have no idea where I put it okay I cannot find in the show notes so let me just find it live and what is our problem this is a book that I start reading I haven't finished it so the read this famous guy wait by why Tim Urban that have a blog post he got famous about many many different techniques on how to be more productive how to fight procrastination he has a famous blog web wait by but why sorry no not the what wait but why where he showcasing tons of the interesting topics and really deep way in a really nice cartoon ish he did he did a famous that talk about procrastination monkey that I highly would recommend everyone to watch if you have not and recently he have released the book actually know how recently I learned about it recently but maybe it was not that that recently oh I don't know when he released it but the point is the book is there and maybe I'm just slowpoke and maybe you are as well if you haven't heard about it so yeah so let me give you the small spoiler it's really small because it's in beginning of the book and you can kind of then then read the rest of yourself but it's really small starting point so he liked to visualize everything so when he starts the book he's visualizing the problem in the following way imagine that the history of the humanity is a book a all the known humanity and everything that humanity deed is just one big book and in reality everything that you know about the humanity and humanity as you know it is just the last one page the previous 999 pages is what have happened before the u.s. or what we can see them on and the modern civilization and you can take person from any of these previous 999 pages and put the same person on any other page and the person would be comfortable nothing have changed really it doesn't matter whether moving this person several pages forward or backward the person will see the exactly same things around that he or she can adopt to but if you take the person from previous 999 pages to the last page the person will not survive because everything have changed drastically and this is mostly because of the exponential growth of the technology and now the final touch to that exponential growth makes everything bigger so we have a bigger good things and we have much bigger worse things the wars and you know we just cross 8 billion population on our planet and then going to cross 9 billion population everything have happened on the last page that we are actually part of it right now so it's doesn't make much to figure out where we going from here and how fast we probably will get there it's just a question how fast we'll get to this I don't know doomsday if you want or something like that so this is a premises you will read this on the first 20 pages so and the rest the rest of the book is answer to this question question what is our problem I will let you know when I finish is reading it maybe the answer is we need to start extending to Mars sooner you know yep yep to be fair if we as a humanity would only kill one planet I would be considering this underachievement of our of our abilities we are capable of killing and messing up way more planet than just one but yes to be fair even though I haven't read the movie yet I read several assays on this topic and they are completely different from different angles from different way of solving that but unfortunately almost everything that I ever read about this specific philosophical topics results in the conclusion that we need to have a some type of force that will unite humanity in one solution that can be implemented and that is effectively a famous famous nice dictator who will solve all our problems and feels like this is unfortunate reality where we either will die or we have to make a mention this future where you ask even you are suddenly realizing that we are have one month left unless in one month we will do something we will reach a point of no returns and then the only way to actually enforce that that's something that need to be done but this is a starting of dictatorship and there will be no way way back and it's sad but I don't know I I'm sure I will not survive until that day comes but good luck to everyone after me anyway any thoughts not directly related to the book but it did remind me the whole conversation about Mars reminded me that if you sign up for Starlink there is a clause in their terms of conditions that basically says users must agree that Mars is a free planet unbound by the authority or sovereignty of any unbound government. This is hilarious. It actually would be cool to see like real you know court case when like judge declining someone to have a rights on Mars because they actually bought a Starlink 20 years ago or something. You know I have this repo I need to find it quickly Jesus I don't remember the name of this repo but it's a license on one of my repositories on github I wrote the license that says that if I have not put the license to any of my code this is the license and explicitly says that US government can use my code for any reasons and no one who forks it can forbid the US government to use this for any reasons yeah I cannot quickly find it but yes anyway like a small story of space and books it was a three-body problem book there was like a short story that someone gifted a distant star to a girl just as a you know like a certificate or something but after many many years people actually start to consider it moving to stars and he sold this like for like oh she sold it for a lot of money because people actually wanted like legal binding man just to keep going on that front and there is this show on TV Apple TV plus Apple TV plus tomorrow tomorrow and this is a show hello tomorrow yes hello tomorrow if you have watched morning show it has one of the star of the morning show from Apple TV plus who is there and the whole idea of that is they are selling houses on the moon and the people who's sending houses on the moon they are in this retro futuristic world if you played fallout they clearly build the universe around the fallout they could have done an amazing job but they did a really shitty TV series I wouldn't recommend anyone to watching it just for the sake of your sanity horrible things and especially horrible because they're using a really nice actors who are much better in other shows like to morning show where these the several guys from here are playing an amazing roles there they are completely horrible here but the TLDR they're selling things on the moon and obviously they probably have guests by now there is nothing on the moon they don't have property they haven't built anything they're just selling that shit and trying to convince everyone that the reason properties on the moon and so they're not selling future they're selling like not selling future constructions and selling something that doesn't exist correct yes they started a selling future obviously and this is a world where this is theoretically possible the humanity constantly flying on the moon and there is a base there and they actually have a project there and you actually can buy the property on the moon you can build something there but in reality they fail to do everything and they just selling bullshit that doesn't exist yes that is hello tomorrow okay anything else from anyone before we jump to the main one of the main topics tonight but honestly this also I think we can go on and on yeah I can I can toss in one book as well for it absolute horrible title but pretty good content the book is called I'll teach you to be rich it's as well the the premise is that most people majority of the people do not have their finances figured out and the book is really trying to help you figure out that like 80 20 rule I think in the book the author refers to at 85% rule and it's really is just trying to help you automate as much of your finances as possible and like get you off some of the bad banks that like are known to be bad for customers and stuff and for you to figure out what is your rich life like it could be like some people it's like the American dream buying a house but there is he like the author really challenges you to think why do you want to buy a house because renting could be better in some circumstances and then like figuring out what things make you happy consciously spend where you do spend but then like automate your savings so it's really just about walking you through six program and the reason I found this book is the the guy also has a show called I'll teach you to be rich on Netflix it's a decent time pass so it was running on the background so we decided to check out the book on like drives and stuff and pretty reasonable I didn't pick up a thing or two but I would say definitely if you are beginner and you're like thinking about getting control of your financial life this is a great book to get started with when I've seen name I thought like the book would be about how to write the book and sell 1 million copies from it but apparently it's it's more useful you know what is that famous district in LA where rich people live I've Beverly Hills Beverly Hills one of them and there used to be a quite popular saying in in Ukraine any book how to be productive for successful is a guy from Beverly Hills teaching the guy from Kiev that he should go outside of his comfort zone to become successful but to be fair I do love books like that so I probably will actually I will end it to my my to to release I love things like that I all into investment but now I have to recommend the audiobook Slava if you are going to get something the guy is also a podcaster so the audiobook is super easy to listen to like one of the easiest to listen to books it's like guys just in his podcast reading his book he's reading his own book yes yeah that's that's cool yeah by the way what is our problem what is the problem they also was new rated by Tim over urban himself so yes I love this tendency when the alters actually new rate in their book but I have to ask me shot so what's your preference are you renting or buying which which group are you in renters or buyers mine to put it on rent yeah that that makes sense that makes sense okay okay so let's jump to next topics so the bus sprouts have released we discuss this last time they released the AI AI for building the narrative for building whatever I don't remember co-host yes co-host AI so we last time discussed that they build a co-host AI this piece of software is incredibly bad I would not recommend it to anyone I finally have tried it I honestly my plan was like that I would try it and then I would build my own pipeline they're doing that shit and I will just move to my pipeline I tried it it was so you explain for me and other people who have no idea what it is and this is because you're you're you skip the last episode but yes yes of course so the TLDR you are putting your episodes to the bus sprouts and then generate show notes proposing five titles to you proposing time sections of your podcast proposing tech social media posts so everything for you which is a really nice idea until you see how it works it's horrible it just generates too many unnecessary buzzwords for your episode and like if I would be reading show notes that they generated I would not be listening that specific show just because it's so high-level so buzz-worthy that you know just losing any meaning so in fact after that I used it unfortunately I don't have the version that it generated but then I completely redesigned pipeline created from scratch I started using whisperer for converting podcasts to text and then effectively pipeline that generating show notes and in doing so I had to figure out how to apply my produce concept for generating show notes because it turns out that the text of the podcast is too big to feed to GPT you cannot just feed the whole podcast as a GPT so I have to implement this small library that I did let me quickly show it which effectively takes the idea of the map reduce and I'm planning the concept classical reproduce concept to the LLMs you can specify LLM you can specify text you can specify the actual prompt and what we'll do it will do the classical reproduce it will chunk it and fully chunk it will send it to to GPT and says here is a chunk of the text here is the end goal and this is chunk number one can you summarize this chunk of the text with any information they need it in the context of this goal it will generate this chunk and then you're doing reduces where you're taking chunks that are generating and then asking you here here is two chunks from part number one part number two can emerge it and create the chunk with them so it's first doing the mapping then reducing and in the end it builds the final chunk that allows it to build the show notes from the bigger bigger podcast that we have it works actually yeah how do you chunk it like by paragraphs by sentences so just like randomly it's literally chunks on the size of the context so right now it's even hard-coded somewhere in the courts somewhere in the court where it's chunk with the size this thing of 8,000 tokens not the tokens characters various various chunks chunks it's a small code and I already can find this hard-coded value and the thing is that if you subtracting it okay split here is a split and if you subtracting it oh yeah it's dynamic okay anyway but to answer your question so I literally splitting the whole string but I doing overlap so if you do overlap you kind of if you split in the middle of the sentence sentence you just need one chunk to go slightly further another chunk to go slightly backwards and then both of them will have split in the middle of the sentence but at the same time you end up with having full coverage because it will be different sentence that got split and this works amazingly well in fact there is only one feature that is missing here I have not I actually do not add right now on the reduce steps number of the chunk so it's actually not capable to derive which part was in the beginning of the show which part was in the end because when I do a reduction it doesn't know if this chunk from the beginning or from the middle from the end so that was a means I need to implement that probably next weekend but it's working surprisingly well it's like literally classical map reduce and by the way this map reduce was written by co-pilot so to some extent it's even AI that wrote that not even me but yes that's that's a gel jar so feel free to use folks it's very simple it has pre prompt for how to do map how to do reduce and yada yada and it's in go so yes not in Python because because because fuck you that's why anyway sorry I recently built to help me with chat GPT I have to write in the Python because libraries in Python and I'm not very worse in Python so I have to use chat GPT to generate all the code and then like copy paste errors and say hey please please fix it you know I picked you go because several one of the teams in the org that I helping to support they have an effort going that they have to implement and go so I kind of needed to make sure that if I need it there I will no go so I end up writing several projects in go now I more or less understand the language but I did zero code reviews and go for the team and I did zero feature implementations for the team so it's to some extent was wasted effort and if I knew that I would fail to help the team with ago I probably would do it in Python as well because it's obviously reducing amount of people who would be using that just because not many people using chat GPT and the programming and go that's that's a very weird niche anyway anyway that was you go for it this is great what you did what you did here just for the sake of comparison I wonder if you should try fathom to do the summary for one of your podcast so you can compare co-hosts fathom and your own script and we can see like for one of the podcasts like what do you get how how do you know that the person is working in a company that does have a budget because the person doesn't know that the tool as it can price tag off please contact our sales department and we will be in touch with you so I would love to use your suggestions but I have no clue even how to install it I literally tried and you know the only prize they have is contact us that's a price probably means like million dollars yeah yes yes I don't know really how how much but yes Nissan is right I'm pretty sure that fountain we do much better job like I'm pretty sure it will do much better job I just have no clue how to use it okay does anyone want to talk about anything else otherwise we'll be keep chatting and keep moving forwards with a full steam on other topics my god I was hoping someone will say something okay let's go to the next one one of the hobbies that the recently picked up is hugs the box it's an extremely interesting service that if you are accustomed to things like lead court or hacker rank this is a very similar things but for the security the reason why I picked it up it's mostly I do honestly believe that with the current development AI security will be the next frontier just because of how everything moving where everything is moving all the friends of mine who are in the security field telling that amount of the black swan events that can bring down the internet are exponentially growing they used to have one per year now they having one for each second week where they need to do emergency patching like on the magnitude that oh someone will figure out how to exploit this we are all doomed so to speak so a lot of the stuff that security folks in the industry especially the networking space are telling just emphasizing that we have a lot of people on the hacking side and we have a lot of people on the AI side but we almost have zero people who are in the both sides who can figure out how to apply AI to the low level true real-world hacking problems and you know it's not that far away the moment where these two fields will interchange and I don't know what it will be but probably the same magnitude of impact that we having with chat GPT so I just want to refresh my skills and some of the low level networking security and to do so I found this hot the box does it work to get like a task to complete or how it works actually yes it's literally exactly like that you see researching the topic about scanning for scanning vulnerabilities scanning networking and then they spinning up via machine that you have quote-unquote to cock and time to time you I'm spending days to figure out how to apply knowledge that I just just figure it out to hug that machine and they do it in a clever way they trying to sell you a subscription but it works in the way that they give you enough internal coins I don't remember the name of those coins so we can purchase the lesson and then when you progress if you finishing the homework and if you will finish all the homework they will give you barely enough credit to purchase the next the next course but if you even behind on one task battle passes in games exactly yes yes exactly like that yes it's remind me exactly that that's a clever and nice I so far so far loved it have not have not skipped even one homework not because I love all of them but just because I didn't want to pay them but you know eventually maybe one day I don't know actually like you know a lot of people talk about the AI in terms of like securities and you know we can give you AI some source code for Mac OS and we'll find vulnerabilities which like zero day right now but I think there are another like idea where AI can actually hurt us without going like to source code level we accumulated a huge amount of personal data everywhere you know like for the photos geolocations like our relations to other people our behaviors and right now you know like this like when you say someone a don't post your personal photos because people can attack you and usually responses I I'm not a superstar I'm not a politician politician no one cares about me but with AI like it's became much more cheaper to target usual people like regular people and I'm always like think about scenarios what if found like all people who going to vacation next week who has old parents in a different country who has a particular bank account and we also know like some personal info about them and we have an ass voice voice examples to make it generated now we can make this attacks okay call their parents ask for money because we are in trouble during our I don't know sailing event or our vacation and if you like just make it automatically scattered across world like it can be actually like very impactful on people lives without everyone like going to some zero day hiking and things what do you think especially with the language modeling I want to say to our listeners I did it with my my old folks and I was highly encouraged to do this well go and design the keyword our sneakers or something and tell your parents that if you calling in your own voice not from the phone number that you have unless you will say that keyword it's not you we this is a this is a reality you if you listening anything yeah that's a bullshit that will not happen to me well I would highly suggest you consider go and develop a keyword and go and share it with your old folks and that's the level of protection you have to do there is no other way I would say going like every time maybe too much but at least if there is a situation when someone asked money from you just you need some confirmation 100% there have been cases of like people exactly like getting the voice modulation right and everything and you you have to have those keywords and especially your topic of bringing it to personal privacy things just reminded me of a study that just came out from the Mozilla group Slava added the link to the show notes they reviewed different car companies privacy policies and if you like scroll down a little bit and there's like all sorts of ranking and Tesla is the worst one if you didn't know they like track everything but what no one expected Nissan is the creepiest one they claim right to your sexual activity and Kia also mentions that they collect information about your sex life in their privacy policy oh and six car companies say that they collect your genetic information or genetic characteristics how like how so here's what I have to think I am fuzzy on details now because this happened a while ago because I signed up for some service in the clause it said because you signed up for us you are giving us permission to pull data from Verizon or T-Mobile like me signing up for service allowed them to ask Verizon for all the information they had that contract but I had to sign up for the service so I wonder if there's more of these behind-the-scenes contracts as soon as you buy the car you sign you sign that contract you now just said yes you are allowed to pull my information so maybe they now can buy it from 23andme and you cannot sue them for doing that because you said it's okay it could be like companies doing it reminds me like law like story that pop-ups couple of years ago so people analyzed a particular TV I don't remember what brand it was but it was pretty much no name brand which is very cheap it makes a shitty TV but you know like some whatever is showing a picture the trick it was they were selling this TV less than manufacturing price and when they try to dig why is this why is this actually business right apparently they they get they got more money from advertising and selling like what what you actually watching then from TV itself it was a pretty interesting case as well I think it was from Dura for someone who did a telegram I think but yes yes I was trying to find the lending for one of the startups that I deeply involved I honestly remember the name I don't remember that the landing page but effectively the whole idea that you would have a service that collects your data and then you selling it to anyone who wants to learn about you so you're you're no longer giving it to anyone and obviously I don't believe that any of such startup will persevere to the level that they need to or want to but the idea is nice that you willingly giving it to like we all give our passwords to one password right we trusting that company so imagine the company that we can trust with our personal data that will keep it secure and we actually in control of giving access to this personal data we can see the data exactly and we can decide which part of the data will go to each company and then you walking to the target and target tells you oh I will give you 25% discount mm-hmm yeah but then you need to also trust all these companies right every time you sell to target you expect them not to lose your data the piece you gave them true but now you're in control you can decide not to it's it's it's exactly this is the point you you now have the in control of your data and this is a different story if you don't trust you I don't have to sell today they are buying our data from providers behind our back and nothing we can do yeah that's that's true it is also a TV that literally comes with a second screen for ads but you get the TV for free okay that's really like from Black Mirror show telly yes that's the one that I was referring to that's I think from the tele tele telegram nope I might be wrong yes that's the one I was referring to yes man that's that's hilarious yes can I put just like a bottom advertising screen on my wall and then start earning money from without the TV just there is something to eat you know there is something to eat like maybe an app for the iPad the app if you opening that app it will turn on the camera to watch you to make sure that it's actually in the living room that people are actually passing by and then it will start give you some money for any person that passed by so it's knows the cameras turn out so it can use cyber vision to effectively figuring out that there are people passing by it can show the ads on the main screen so yeah there is something to eat that we can together collectively bring this humanity to the end much faster than we thought in the beginning of this show we just need to brainstorm more anyway anyway there is several things else to discuss but any other things that someone have recalled before we jump to I can talk about games but I see you put Starfield as well so I think we can it will be enough for one show to be fair I have not played Starfield I know it's out I I know that someone in my house is the special Starfield constellation edition I know that but I don't have it yet but somewhere in my house somewhere I can talk in spite of advertising a bit so I on the PlayStation there is a way to play trials for games like and it's time time-based like one hour five hours 30 minutes depends on the game and recently I started to play Fort Solis which is and it has like one hour demo it's a it's unconstrained but you just have one hour and the game essentially is walking simulator you know you just walk do something in game put in a general like you are a technical station there is no one you know like a bit spooky but nothing really happening and they did so good on timing the first one hour like you go out from not spooky to almost spooky and the last moment when I started to see something spooky the game ended because like my one hour left it's probably the best advertisement I ever get because they got me hooked in the exact moment and now I'm considering to buy it which is very very smart decision and I haven't seen it like before it's it's really good timing they did but it's really hard to do because each player will unless I'm saying it's not I mean it's kind of linear because you walk like pretty much on corridors like open doors but you still you know can stay you can read something I don't know how maybe maybe I just was like it like other people don't do it I'm pretty sure you can just stay and don't get this effect but for me it works well maybe they just did a lot of play tests and see like this is an average time when people get to this room okay does it come to Xbox exclusive his first one is going door-to-door offering blah blah blah blah blah so does it or does it not I don't have a lease for Xbox I hate you I hate you why why are you doing this to me you know that I have Xbox you first saw the game I want to play and it doesn't exist an Xbox okay okay so are you going to buy it or not maybe you know like I'm in an age and the time where money is not constrained but decision to spend time on the game is a constraint so I will think about it got it got it got it okay I think we can all start advocating for that for the week that's happening in Europe and at least in some places countries have started experimenting with that so we can reclaim one day per week for gaming tell me tell me more what is that and it's not a you're muted you are muted but I'm pretty sure you're telling something awesome oh yeah yeah so I'm using push to talk and then I started searching on the side I think it was either friends or some Nordic country they were experimenting with four day work weeks last year and I think the results were promising is is what I remember reading but if you don't find it now I'll have it ready for the next podcast and we can follow up on this yeah for the week right now is is also advocating for that who Bernie Sanders Oh Bernie Sanders oh that socialist guy okay okay yes sure in his age even if us will go under he probably will not will not survive till that moment so I but I know you know who else went to four days week that was the green up for the note-taking with elephant as a main as a main symbol I'm pretty sure you ever not ever not yes ever not was a famous company that went to four days week for working four days working week are they still around I think they went under I think they sold some people just can't migrate from it and they stuck maybe yes yes but to be fair I I don't mind of course I don't mind unless it's my startup then I do mind and my startup no I'm advocating to go to six six days for week as a working norm but yes that's that's a different story you will have to move your business to China I mean the whole premise is that people are more productive over four days then then six days I guess over long periods of time that's true in a in a short time you can do I think the main issue is like if government enforces it it's not making people more productive because it goes like a cross all like if work is a you know moving something from left to right you probably will be more product like you will do more in more days right depending on a job yeah for sure if it's like physical labor thing yeah I cannot do six days of labor in four days if it's thinking jobs and creativeness I don't have one extra day we'll spend playing games it's it's actually in this topic because I think like for this week it will come eventually but not because people care about productivity just like we have so many people and we automate so many things so just need to keep people somehow busy but we don't have job enough for everyone unless we start building pyramids or something oh go go to Mars you know even though it's the people are more productive you can fix it by the other way you can have more people if you have bigger amount of people different things and that's remind me about culture nine and six that's the resume and website and github rappers so this is quite popular in the China so that's why the China Chinese folks are created the huge project nine and six ICU with a list of companies that support this so nine and six is you working from 9 a.m. till 9 p.m. six days a week so that's what money what it means culture nine and six and obviously this was a cause leading cost of many deaths in China where this is actually actively employed because especially if you're doing creative job and you've been forced to keep doing creating job nine to nine without the weekends yes it can lead to a lot of complications to your psychological life yeah my grandma told me like after war in second world war in Soviet Union there was like a lot of you know distractions and a lot of like factories closed and they need to rebuild everything and they have some working Saturdays but not every working Saturday I think was like once per month and people called black Saturday because it's like a six days and for me was like kind of norm because they understand what they doing but it was still like extra day time to time when you know you shouldn't go for it I saw your immediate yourself go for it oh I was gonna just link it to something else so if you want to finish first I wanted to say something but already forgot so you go I saw a video I think that came out of Japan where the office had like really nice setups for like you could sleep and everything and everyone was going oh that's so sweet for the employer but then like then someone was like actually if you're spending 72 hours or 80 hours a week that is that becomes more of a necessity than like a perk that the employer is providing if you're literally just spending your life in the office so that's kind of what 996 reminds me of yeah that's that's remind me now when you said this when I used to work you used to be working one big company from the South Korea I've spent tons of the time in South Korea and then you they used to have a dormitory right next to the office so you you you can go there and sleep it would you have to pay for it something and that's what's that was horrible it was really really horrible it was work from home you don't even have to go to the building next door it's remember the stories like people from Google sleep in advance on the parking lot so they don't need to pay a friend you know that story by the way is true but this is for old old Google and it got famous back in the day but now people telling in the context that they don't want to pay rent in reality when that was actually extremely popular that was a time when you can live in RV for two years and buy a house even if you like a junior in Google so a lot of junior middle engineers were doing so there was like internal forum where you can ask where to park your we were the security is not often comes around you just need to survive two years and you can buy a house in cash obviously the time long gone no one no one doing it anymore but the story is still still still there with us but yes it used to be true it it reminds me I was working in a startup in Moscow and I was living outside my commute was like more than one hour and sometimes if after office I go like you know to the bar or somewhere to spend time it's like super late and I'm too lazy to go for commuter I went to office like no one is there so I can sleep there that morning I'm already on the work that's such an amazing story yeah sorry I was updating show notes okay I do have just one more thing that would more or less be enough for the final accord of the evening but is anyone else want to share anything before I will jump to the movies section well let me say one last thing about games then on what happened last week there was an article that came out that Rockstar games which is a pretty big studio in gaming found two be selling pirated games on Steam so to get it on their own and then in comments in various places I think I read one of them that the person was talking about they reading out to the company about like getting an installer for a game but the game was old so the company was like just go get the pirated version we don't have the files anymore but this is it's pretty crazy that you you go on Steam you think you know you're buying the real game and the company's just selling you a pirated version oh my god this is hilarious that's remind me who do you mind seeing you you want how much I would remember there was a game from which they lost all the source code oh it was a Heroes of Might and Magic 3 right right because I remember they actually like they made version 5 but I was very happy about that and then after some time I upgraded iOS version it says like there is no you can't really play this game because now and when I start digging I found that they completely lost all sources so they couldn't really adapt for new version of iPod OS I think it was that one yes the expansion packs were not included because the source code for those releases were lost Jesus how they managed to do so oh my god oh my god I'm pretty sure someone right now rewriting the source code from scratch together with open API here is a screenshot of my game can you write please a unity code for that with that screenshot and then doing it from scratch I'm pretty sure someone somewhere doing so it's actually interesting idea right like what if you give AI a game you know just like a control since I get play until you understand how it works so you can write code for me yes and then okay now make it not safe for work as much as you can let's see how it will look like okay okay for for those type of topics let's go to the movies section and I okay let me just share several things that are old but I still would like to share them first is that last song if you haven't watched that last song I would highly recommend you to do so but you have to promise to me that you will stop in the season one it's unbearable to to to say how shitty the season two and three comparing to season one I yes usually the TV series when you probably hearing this you'll be saying yeah I know the season two is always always a little bit worse than season one like no that's a different movie it's it's just unbearable to watch I don't know how they managed to do so I remember you told me I because when I finish first one yeah it's a good ending I will I'm not going to watch it kudos to you my friend you did the right thing Nissan I mean I have seen all three seasons I think they picked it up in season three I really did enjoy season three so there was at least you know some come back there you know there are episodes that are amazing in season two and season three that by themselves as a really nice standalone movie that you can watch and to be fair if you would start with season two without any prior expectations that is a decent serious by itself but this is comparing with season one constantly and he might felt like you're about to say something okay so who is for who is watched recently anything new and interesting otherwise I'll just keep going with what I have watched recently I put one piece there I'll go I just finished watching the after party season two if you have not seen the after party it is a pretty good show if you are especially into murder mysteries so there is a murder and then they have a pretty interesting way of like you know walking you through each person's story so the premise is that this police officer really likes to listen to everyone's story because they are the main characters so you basically get to see a movie each time and then in the end like they put everything together and solve the murder but every episode especially in season two was done that like a 50s themes so it's like everyone has like dramatic takes on like oh this is what was going on and it was pretty like I would say like some inspirations from Agatha Christie kind of who done it stuff but it was a really good season but if it's a murder mystery is a cliffhanger in the end of the first or you know who is there they solve the murder in season one there is a different murder in season two and this all that too so they're like disconnected right same cast actually so you I'm not gonna say more than that it's remind me the Jesus I forgot the name of the movie but anyway I may be able to call I think Dima you also wanted to say to share something about the movies before I will share some impression about Oppenheimer yeah so I watched one piece couple of episodes on Netflix just for the context one piece is a Japanese manga which like really long and also Japanese anime which started like in 1999 and still going it's like too long I never actually watched it because again I don't have that time in my life to watch all of it and the thing about animes like usually when it's goes to life it's very shitty like I can't recall any anime that was adopted as a live show and became decent they all very bad I think one decent example was Ghost in the Shell which was pretty much just converted to Western action movie but this is very surprisingly like nicely adopted it still has all this craziness from anime like that would you expect but for some reason it's like nice to watch like decent actors do you think like a setting and it doesn't try to be serious like it's it's pretty much like a if we get anime with all this like crazy stuff going on and exegregation of everything and put in a live show and it looks fine like I really like it and I can recommend if you want something like a pretty again crazy adventures of pirates that's that's a premise yeah I got it probably I added on my side to your watch list for me probably will watch eventually thank you and I in the end do want to share my impressions from the Oppenheimer 50 million millimeters film of 70 not the 50 70 yes oh where did you watch it in Dublin or in San Francisco in Dublin yes there are like only 12 cinemas in the North America that can show you the proper Oppenheimer in 70 millimeters you know by the way I've seen different views of viewpoints some of the folks will tell you that it doesn't doesn't have you don't have to go to there and it's not actually warrant for me I definitely would suggest to go and watch specifically 70 millimeters so what the 70 millimeters say marks that support that can give you it's actually will give you a future max screen that can show you the picture in the size of the square not the little square when x is equal to y and what they doing an Oppenheimer they showing you three different version of the picture they showing you the grayscale version which is effectively when they show you grayscale they show you the historical events and they unfolded in real life then they showing you the color movie in their usual ratio not the square but usual movie ratio on the screen that would be the classical movie and periodically they going to this square movie but the square not in the usual cinema the square would be trimmed from the size to show you square in this case it's actually when they showing normal movie it's trimmed on the top on the bottom because the IMAX at capable 70 millimeters have a huge square in front of you so when they going to this certain movie certain mode so to speak you suddenly see much bigger screen that you will see in the movie usually and that creates a wall effect and even more it creates a continuous and wall effect and again again again because they only going to the certain mode periodically so imagine that they showing you a movie and suddenly they want to show you a close-up face so for that face for the facial expression they might go to a square when you have a much bigger ability to zoom in because if you zooming in on the classical ratio of the cinema on someone's face face still in the middle you have a tons of the screen useless in this case they can zoom in and show you face much bigger and each time when they're showing either face or something they put additional emphasis and it's just amazing and again because they're going back and forth and not constantly in this mode it's create this wall effect again and again and again because it hits right when you forgot that they even capable of showing you this and again you seeing it oh my god yes that's so cool yeah so you did like visuals what about like a story plot actors everything else is it there or you just like so good on visuals that you don't care about other parts no I you know I so it's amazing movie that's still there it is amazing movie I knew a lot of the story of the Oppenheimer and because they trying to tell the story to some extent close to the real story it was just fine and use the story so to speak I knew how the bomb made how it looks like what was the sequence of event how they derived it so from that perspective it sure you know the story they uncovering you a lot of underground parts that shape the story so to speak there was one particular moment it's probably not going to be a big spoiler it's probably not a spoiler at all but there was a actually no I'm not going to tell you I'm not going to you have to go and watch it I don't want to spoil it but yes I love the dialogue well what what thank you I appreciate not spoiling the movie here you go but it was extremely hard to find the tickets so we literally were monitoring tickets which was all sold out for 70 millimeters constantly until one morning early morning we were going with several friends to somewhere I don't remember where we were going I just just casually opened the cinema and we see oh there is a four tickets 20 minutes from now in the moment where we're leaving leaving to go there someone returned it but nope we're going we have to go there like 20 minutes is enough to draw there we came there five minutes late because the 70 millimeters they don't have almost any pre-screen because none of the advertisement are fitting that screen so they literally starting the movie at the hour so we arrived five minutes late expecting that the movie would start 15 minutes late and we walked into the theater in the middle of the movie because it's already was airing that was by itself a surprise so that was a TLDR highly recommend highly recommend anyway I actually think we are precisely at one hour but if someone has anything else to share please do now is the time now is the time I think we're good for today okay so let me move everything to the backlog of the topics and with that thank you folks and we'll chat and see you all of you in the same place same time next week and you folks can say goodbyes goodbye have a nice weekend everyone bye see you you
